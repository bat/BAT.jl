In BAT, all likelihood functions and priors are subtypes of <code>BAT.AbstractDensity</code>. We&#39;ll store the histogram that we want to fit in our likelihood density type, as accessing the histogram as a global variable would <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/index.html#Avoid-global-variables-1">reduce performance</a>:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">struct HistogramLikelihood{H&lt;:Histogram,F&lt;:Function} &lt;: AbstractDensity

    likelihood::HistogramLikelihood,
    params::Union{NamedTuple,AbstractVector{&lt;:Real}}
)
    # Histogram counts for each bin as an array:

        log_likelihood += logpdf(Poisson(expected_counts), observed_counts)
    end

    return log_likelihood
end</code></pre><p>BAT makes use of Julia&#39;s parallel programming facilities if possible, e.g. to run multiple Markov chains in parallel, and expects implementations of <code>BAT.density_logval</code> to be thread safe. Mark non-thread-safe code with <code>@critical</code> (using Julia package <code>ParallelProcessingTools</code>).</p><p>BAT requires Julia v1.3 or newer to use multi-threading. Support for automatic parallelization across multiple (local and remote) Julia processes is planned, but not implemented yet.</p><p>Note that Julia currently starts only a single thread by default, you will need to set the environment variable <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/environment-variables/#JULIA_NUM_THREADS-1"><code>JULIA_NUM_THREADS</code></a> to specify the number of Julia threads.</p><p>Using our likelihood density definition and the histogram to fit, we can now create our data- and fit-function-specific likelihood instance:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">likelihood = HistogramLikelihood(hist, fit_function)</code></pre><pre><code class="language-none">Main.ex-tutorial.HistogramLikelihood{StatsBase.Histogram{Int64,1,Tuple{StepRangeLen{Float64,Base.TwicePrecision{Float64},Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}}}},typeof(Main.ex-tutorial.fit_function)}(StatsBase.Histogram{Int64,1,Tuple{StepRangeLen{Float64,Base.TwicePrecision{Float64},Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}}}}

This way, users may implement complex application-specific priors. You can also use <code>convert(AbstractDensity, distribution)</code> to convert any continuous multivariate <code>Distributions.Distribution</code> to a <code>BAT.AbstractDensity</code> that can be used as a prior (or likelihood).</p><p>The prior also implies the shapes of the parameters:</p><pre><code class="language-julia">using ValueShapes
