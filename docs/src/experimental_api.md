# Experimental features

These are experimental features. Forward/backward compatibility does *not*
follow [Julia's semantic versioning rules](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/compatibility/).
Instead, compatibility is only guaranteed across changes in patch version, but
*not* across changes of minor (or major) version changes.
