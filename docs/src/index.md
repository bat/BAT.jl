# BAT Documentation

Welcome to BAT, the Bayesian analysis toolkit. This is a (still incomplete) rewrite of the previous [C++ version](https://github.com/bat/bat) in Julia.


## Installation

BAT.jl is under development and not a registered Julia package yet. Install via

```julia
using Pkg
pkg"add https://github.com/BAT/BAT.jl.git"
```


## Developer Instructions

When changing the code of BAT.jl and testing snippets and examples in the REPL, automatic code reloading comes in very handy. Try out [Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl).
